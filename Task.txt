Create a prototype of the 2D motorcycle game like Hill Climb or Bike Race.
No graphics is required - lines, rects and circles are fine.
You control a motorcycle which moves over randomly generated 2D terrain. Motorcycle should have suspension on both wheels.
If you tap on the right side of the screen, motorcycle accelerates, if you tap on the left side - it slows down.
In the top left corner of the screen there should be text with the distance that motorcycle has traveled.
If motorcycle makes a wheelie, a “Wheelie!” text should appear in the right top corner.
If motorcycle falls over, the game automatically restarts.
The look & feel of the game should be correct on any screen resolution.
Проект должен открываться в последней версии Юнити + APK. Сторонние ассеты использовать можно только для визуала.
